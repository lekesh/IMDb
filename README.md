Extracted the move data-set from Kaggle to perform Data Cleaning, EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) and Visualisations of various attributes

Libraries used: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Numpy and Pyplot.

Found some interesting correlations and drawn some meaningfull conclusions from the visualised data.

Future plans: Update the visualisations with Pyplot Express to create interactive charts and utilise the year attribute to apply some time series analysis.
